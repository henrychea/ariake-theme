# Ariake Dark Syntax theme

Ariake Dark is a Jetbrains (Phpstorm, Webstorm etc.) theme that I forked from [jim-at-jibba/ariake-theme](https://github.com/jim-at-jibba/ariake-theme)

## Install

Open any IntelliJ app and import the theme in Prefences->Editor->Color Scheme

#### Special Notes

- Has support for _Rainbow Brackets_ (makes them look almost identical to the ones in VS Code)
- The include .xml theme will work with _Material Theme UI_ as a custom theme import
